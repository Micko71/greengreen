- Password: monkeymagic

#### Heating

Gas heaters are provided in all rooms. Please make an effort to keep warm while minimizing heater use by observing the following:  
- Put more clothes on!
- Keep doors closed.
- Gas heats rooms very quickly so there is no need to leave heaters on in empty rooms.
- Operate heaters on the lowest temperature setting.  Heaters will function continuously at a gentle pace and keep the room at a comfortable temperature.
- Electric blankets are provided for beds.  These can be turned on to heat beds before you get into them, although you will probably want to turn these off before you go to sleep.
- Quality doonas and blankets are provided. You should be able to have a warm and comfortable sleep without leaving the heaters on overnight.
- Please ensure all heaters are turned off whenever you leave the house.
