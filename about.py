            #### Welcome to Greengreen Guesthouse! 
             
This property was purchased as an akia (abandoned house) in 2019 and restored  with the aim of bringing back to life the original ambience of this 70â€™s era Japanese snow-country home. 

The guesthouse has two floors and a basement.  Each floor has its own kitchen, bathroom, toilet and living area, and each can function as a self-contained two bedroom apartment sleeping up to 4 people.  

The basement has a communal dry room and Ski/Snowboard/Equipment storage area. The basement can also be used for Ski Tuning.

Greengreen Guesthouse  is located in the village of Suginosawa, at the base of Mt Myoko and Suginohara Ski Resort.  Guests can access Suginohara Ski Resort via the Suginohara Romance Chair which is 200 meters from the guesthouse.

Please enjoy your stay at Greengreen Guesthouse!"""
